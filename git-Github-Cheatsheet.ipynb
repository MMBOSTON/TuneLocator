    "\n",
    "1. `git init`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a new `.git` directory that stores all the necessary metadata for the new repository. This includes subdirectories for `objects`, `refs/heads`, `refs/tags`, and template files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. It's a good practice to run `git status` before running other Git commands to get a summary of your current project status.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `git add .`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command adds all the files in the current directory (and its subdirectories) to the staging area. The staging area is a place where Git keeps track of changes that you want to include in your next commit. The `.` represents the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `git commit -m \"Initial commit\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command creates a new commit with the changes that are currently in the staging area. The `-m` option allows you to include a commit message directly from the command line. In this case, the commit message is \"Initial commit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `git remote add origin https://github.com/MMBOSTON/TuneLocator.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command adds a new remote repository to your local Git configuration. The remote repository is located at `https://github.com/MMBOSTON/TuneLocator.git`, and you're giving it the short name `origin`. This short name allows you to refer to this remote repository more easily in other Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `git push origin master:main`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command pushes the `master` branch from your local repository to the `main` branch on the remote repository `origin`. If the `main` branch doesn't exist on the remote repository, it will be created. The changes from your local `master` branch will be uploaded to the remote repository, making them available to others and creating a backup of your work on the remote server."
